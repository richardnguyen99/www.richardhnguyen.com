              I&apos;m a software engineer from the Washington, US. Writing
              software and blogs that help people solve problems is my passion.
              My specialties are building fullstack web applications from modern
              frameworks such as NextJS and React, old school server-side
              rendered like Flask and Django to complete HTTP servers in C.

        <h4>My story</h4>

        <p>I was born in Vietnam in 1999 and lived there unitl 2019.</p>

        <p>
          I was attending to{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          for my second year with a Finance major. Although I love economy and
          finance, I hate using the tools that are available for me to work with
          such as Excel and Stata. Then, I found out about Python and its
          ecosystem for data analysis and data manipulation. Tools like Pandas,
          Numpy, and Matplotlib got me hooked into programming. Since then, I
          fell for it and discovered my passion for software engineering.

          In 2019, my family and I moved to the US. I decided to switch my major

        <h4>My work</h4>

        <p>My strength is building fullstack web applications.</p>

        <p>
          I have experience with modern frontend frameworks and tools like ESM,
          TypeScript, React NextJS. I&apos;m also capable of building backend
          services with Flask, Django and Express, from a complete server-side
          rendered application to a RESTful API server.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also write blogs about software engineering, programming and coding
          tips. That is the reason why I built this blog site. It&apos;s a place
          where I can share my knowledge and what I learned during my journey as
          a software engineer. I hope this site can inspired you to try new
          stuff. Or for some tech savvy, you can inspect{" "}

        <h4>My hobbies</h4>

        <p>
          My favorite hobby is programming and writing OSS, very obvious right?
          When I&apos;m not coding, I like to hangout with my friends. My
          favorite activity is hiking and camping. Every summer, I hike{" "}

          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          I also play video games. My two favorite games are{" "}

          >
            NieR: Replicant
          </a>
          . I love these games because the philosophy and the story behind them,
          not to mention the music in Nier games are amazing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading books is also another hobby of mine. I mainly read books when
          I&apos;m on the bus, at the station or when I&apos;m waiting for
          someone. My genres are mostly fantasy and philosophical books. Here is
          my favorite book list if you are interested.
