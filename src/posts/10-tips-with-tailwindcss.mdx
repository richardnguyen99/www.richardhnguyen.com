Over the past couple of years, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has
become one of the most popular CSS frameworks for building modern websites. The
beauty of TailwindCSS is that it allows you to build complex designs without
worrying about creating separate components. This post will show you 10 tips
that will help you get the most out of TailwindCSS.

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build complex
designs from a composition of small, single-purpose utility classes directly in
your markup. TailwindCSS works perfectly with browser-heavy frameworks like
React, Vue and server-side frameworks like Next.js thanks to its efficiency and
zero runtime.

TailwindCSS proves that it resolves many issues of working with CSS and UI
systems. You can have a better grasp of your components by looking at them in
your components' markup. You save time and energy from coming up with names
for a simple component.

<div className="mb-8">
  <CSSComparisonChart />
</div>

# Arbitrary values

TailwindCSS ships with a predefined set of utility classes that you can use
immediately. For example, Tailwind provides a set of predefined [color system](
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) and [spacing system](
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale). You
can use them directly in your markup.

```html
<div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
  <p className="text-white">Hello, world!</p>
</div>
```

However, you can also use arbitrary values in your utility classes with the
syntax `property-[value]`. For example:

```html
<div
  class="bg-[#bada55] text-[22px] before:content-['Festivus'] grid grid-cols-[fit-content(theme(spacing.32))]"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This feature works very well with properties that support arbitrary values like
`background-color`, `font-size`, `color`, etc. However, properties like
`display` don't support arbitrary values.

# Arbitrary properties

TailwindCSS also allows you to use arbitrary properties in your utility classes
to use some CSS properties that are not covered by TailwindCSS. For example:

```html
<div class="[mask-type:luminance] hover:[mask-type:alpha] [display:block]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This syntax is like how you would write CSS in a stylesheet and you wrap around
the property with square brackets. You can also use this feature to write
custom CSS variables:

```html
<div class="[--my-custom-property:10px]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

<Callout title="Whitespace caution" type="warning" collapsible>

A common mistake is to use some whitespaces in the syntax like how you would do
in CSS. However, TailwindCSS doesn't support whitespaces in the syntax. You can
either remove the whitespaces or use an underscore `_` instead.

```html
<!-- This will not work -->
<div class="[mask-type: luminance]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>

<!-- This will work -->
<div class="[mask-type:_luminance]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

</Callout>

# Dynamic styles

A common case in building web components is to apply styles based on some sort
of states. For example, we have a button component that changes its background
color based on the state of the button.

```tsx
{/* This won't work */}
<button className={`bg-${
  state === "danger" ? "red" : (
  state === "warning" ? "yellow" : "blue"
)}-500`}>
</button>
```

This won't work because TailwindCSS doesn't support dynamic styles or any
client-side logics. Every class names must be extractable at build time.

```tsx
{/* This will work */}
<button className={`${
  state === "danger" ? "bg-red-500" : (
  state === "warning" ? "bg-yellow-500" : "bg-blue-500"
)}`}>
</button>
```

# Client-side styles

But what if there is a situation where you really need to apply styles from the
client-side? For example, you are building a floating modal that needs the
current width of the device screen so that you can set the appropriate padding

```tsx {11,17}
import { useWindowSize } from "@uidotdev/usehooks";

function App() {
  const { width } = useWindowSize();

  return (
    <main
      className="flex flex-col items-center gap-8 py-16 max-w-[1280px] mx-auto"
      style={
        {
          "--container-size": `${width}px`,
        } as CSSProperties
      }
    >
      {/* ... */}

      <p className="absolute bottom-4 bg-amber-500 p-4 rounded-lg w-[calc(var(--container-size)-48px)] left-[24px] border border-yellow-700 text-amber-50">
        Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

<div className="mb-12">
  <CodeSandbox
    src="https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/upbeat-yonath-wxjrrc"
    title="TailwindCSS client-side styles"
  />
</div>

# Traditional classnames

Having a lot of utility classes in your markup can be overwhelming. Imaging
looking at a component like this:

```html
<div class="rounded-s w-full h-full [&_img]:scale-100 group-hover:[&_img]:scale-105 group-hover:[&_video]:scale-105 [&_img]:transform-gpu [&_video]:transform-gpu [&_img]:transition-transform [&_img]:ease-curve-d [&_img]:duration-normal [&_video]:transition-transform [&_video]:ease-curve-d [&_video]:duration-normal w-1/2 mx-auto transition-opacity ease-curve-c duration-normal max-w-media relative">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Sometimes with components like this, it's better to put all the CSS rules in a
traditional CSS class and use that one class in your markup. Luckily, TailwindCSS provides a native way to do this with the `@apply` directive.

```css
.card {
  @apply rounded-s w-full h-full mx-auto relative max-w-media;
  @apply [&_img]:scale-100 group-hover:[&_img]:scale-105 group-hover:[&_video]:scale-105;
  @apply [&_img]:transform-gpu [&_img]:transition-transform [&_img]:ease-curve-d [&_img]:duration-normal
  @apply [&_video]:transform-gpu [&_video]:transition-transform [&_video]:ease-curve-d [&_video]:duration-normal;
  @apply transition-opacity ease-curve-c duration-normal;
}
```

```html
<div class="card">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This way is very useful particularly when you write blogs or documentation that
uses many uniformed, reusable components.

# Directives

However, writing custom CSS classes in CSS files does not give a good
developing experience. The first thing is that it might cause some compiling
issues if you are not careful with the `@layers` directive in TailwindCSS[^1].
Secondly, intellisense on your editor, like [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
does not give any suggestions for your custom CSS classes.

To solve this issue, you can use the [Tailwind Plugin System](
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) to create reusable, custom styles. For
example:

```js title="tailwind.config.js" showLineNumbers
import plugin from "tailwindcss/plugin";

const config = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx,md,html}",
  ],
  prefix: "",
  corePlugins: {},
  theme: {},
  plugins: [
    // Other plugins
    plugin(function ({ addUtilities, theme }) {
      addUtilities({
        ".content-container": {
          marginLeft: "var(--article-gutter-size)",
          marginRight: "var(--article-gutter-size)",
          marginBottom: theme("spacing.4"),
          width: "var(--article-container-size)",
        },
      });
    }),
    plugin(function ({ addComponents, theme }) {
      addComponents({});
    }),
  ],
};

export default config;
```

Modern text editor with TailwindCSS Intellisense will tell you what the class
is expanded to.

# Using TailwindCSS Intellisense

Speaking of TailwindCSS Intellisense, it is a must have extension for developers
to work with TailwindCSS. It provides

- **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as CSS
functions and directives.
- **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your
markup.
- **Hover Previews**. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by
hovering over it.
- **Syntax Highlighting**. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind
features are highlighted correctly.

![Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](/tailwind-intellisense.png)

Unfortunately, TailwindCSS Intellisense does not provide any official support for other editors than Visual Studio Code. However, TailwindCSS Intellisense
also provides a [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/tree/main/packages/tailwindcss-language-server)
that you can use to build your own TailwindCSS Intellisense for other editors.

# Using TailwindCSS Prettier Plugin

Another must-have extension for working with TailwindCSS in VsCode is the
[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). This plugin simply
sorts and organizes your utility classes in your markup based on the TailwindCSS
 recommended order.

![TailwindCSS Prettier Plugin](/tailwind-prettier-plugin.jpg)

Since this is a Prettier plugin, it will work seamlessly wherever Prettier works
in your project, popular IDEs or text editors, and even on command line.


```html
<!-- Before -->
<button class="text-white px-4 sm:px-8 py-2 sm:py-3 bg-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-800">...</button>

<!-- After -->
<button class="bg-sky-700 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-sky-800 sm:px-8 sm:py-3">...</button>
```

# Override TailwindCSS classes

Overriding existing styles in existing components is a common case when working
with TailwindCSS. An easy and direct way to override classes is to use the
important modifier `!`. For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 !bg-red-500">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

However, thou shalt not use `!important` in CSS. Another way to override is to
use [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge).

```tsx
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

twMerge('px-2 py-1 bg-red hover:bg-dark-red', 'p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]')
// → 'hover:bg-dark-red p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]'
```

# Refactor TailwindCSS classes

As mentioned above, having a lot of utility classes in your markup is a pain.
Put all the CSS rules in a traditional CSS class is helpful. But what if the
component contains some conditions such as states, variants, etc.? Or even, you
just want to break down the utility classes into smaller pieces that fit your
80-character line limit?

Packages like [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) and [clsx](
https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) allow you to combine multiple classes into
one classname string. For example:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import clsx from "clsx";

interface ButtonProps {
  size: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  color: "red" | "green" | "blue";
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ variant, size, color }) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx(
        "px-4 py-2",
        size === "sm" && "text-sm",
        size === "md" && "text-md",
        size === "lg" && "text-lg",
        color === "red" && "bg-red-500",
        color === "green" && "bg-green-500",
        color === "blue" && "bg-blue-500"
      )}
    >
      Click me
    </button>
  );
};
```

You can also combine `clsx` with `tailwind-merge` to create a robust utility
function for managing your styles. For example, creating a reusable function
to handle that all together:

```ts title="src/lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

And then use it in  your reusable components that allow you to specify the class
later:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

const Card = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "rounded-xl border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow",
      className,
    )}
    {...props}
  />
));
Card.displayName = "Card";
```
