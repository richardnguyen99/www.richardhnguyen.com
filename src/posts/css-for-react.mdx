Back in the old days, we can just link up a CSS file in the `<head>` tag of our
HTML document and we call it a day. But with the rise of React applications,
this is getting harder and harder. More modern CSS techniques are invented to
solve problems of CSS with React. But what are they?

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to style the HTML elements and make
them look better, more appealing. CSS seems to be easy to configure and use. You
can just write some CSS code, or might use a third-party library like Bootstrap
and link up their CDN in your HTML files. But now, with the rise of React and
single-page applications, things are getting more complicated. Due to the nature
of bundling and optimization[^1], it is recommended to keep your CSS during the
React compiling process.

# CSS styling

Writing your own CSS has been a good way to style your React components. It's
also a good way if  you want to control and customize your design system. There
are many ways to achieve this.

## Use vanilla CSS

The most simple way to style your React components is to write your CSS rules.
But instead of linking up in the `<head>` tag, you import your CSS file in your
React root component. This allows the CSS to be optimized and bundled better in
production build[^2].

```css title="Button.css" showLineNumbers
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```jsx title="Button.jsx" showLineNumbers
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './Button.css'; // Tell webpack that Button.js uses these styles

const Button = () => {
  return <button className="Button">Click me</button>;
};
```

## Use CSS modules

CSS modules is a way to scope your CSS to a specific component. Instead of
having a massive CSS file that styles all the components, CSS modules allows you
to have a CSS file for each component. Another benefit of CSS modules is that it
prevents CSS class name conflicts[^3], even if you use the same class name in a
component.

```ansi
. src/
└── Button/
    ├── Button.module.css
    └── Button.tsx
```

```css title="Button.module.css" showLineNumbers
.error {
  color: red;
}
```

```css title="app.css" showLineNumbers
.error {
  background-color: red;
}
```

```tsx title="Button.tsx" showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Button.module.css'; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
import './app.css'; // Import regular stylesheet

const Button = () => {
  return <button className={styles.error}>Click me</button>;
};
```

The result of the above code is that the button will have a red text color from
the `.error` class in `Button.module.css`.

```html
<!-- This button has red text, not the red background -->
<button class="Button_error_xazx5">Error Button</button>
```

## Use SCSS

SCSS is a superset of CSS that allows you to write CSS with more features like
mixins and variables. For example, if you want to create a gutter system for
margins and paddings, you can use SCSS to loop through the values and create
classes for them.

```scss title="gutter.scss" showLineNumbers
// Define the breakpoints map
$breakpoints: (
  "xs": 0px,
  "sm": 576px,
  "md": 768px,
  "lg": 992px,
  "xl": 1200px,
  "xxl": 1400px // [!code ++]
);

// Mixin to generate margin rules for each breakpoint
@mixin generate-margin-rules {
  @each $breakpoint, $min-width in $breakpoints {
    // Define media query for each breakpoint
    @media (min-width: #{$min-width}) {
      @for $i from 1 through 64 {
        .m-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .mt-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-top: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .mr-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-right: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .mb-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-bottom: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .ml-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-left: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .mx-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-left: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
          margin-right: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
        .my-#{$i}-#{$breakpoint} {
          margin-top: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
          margin-bottom: #{($i * 0.25)}rem;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To use SCSS in your React project, you need to install `sass` package:

```shell
npm install sass
# or
yarn add sass
```

Then you can replace your `src/App.css` with `src/App.scss` and import it in
your React component:

```scss title="App.scss" showLineNumbers
@import 'gutter.scss';

.App {
  // Other style rules
}
```

```jsx title="App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';
import './App.scss';

const App = () => {
  return <div className="App">Hello World</div>;
};
```

React has an official guide on how to use SCSS in your React projects
[here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/).

# CSS frameworks

Major CSS frameworks provide pre-built components and styles that you can use.
They provide functionalities for common used components like buttons, forms,
modals, etc.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap has been a popular CSS framework since the 2011. It provides Bootstrap
components and utilities that you can use to style your applications. However,
Bootstrap is not React-specific so you need to install React adapters such as
[react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) or [reactstrap](
https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page).

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'reactstrap';

export default (props) => {
  return <Button color="danger">Danger!</Button>;
};
```

## Material UI

MUI is a popular React component library maintained by teams at Google. Unlike
Bootstrap, MUI is React-specific and provides React native components that you
can use in your React applications. MUI also provides providers and hooks that
you can use to customize the theme and styles of your components.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import * as React from 'react';
import Card from '@mui/material/Card';
import ListItem from '@mui/material/ListItem';

export default function SpecificRefType() {
  const cardRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const listItemRef = React.useRef<HTMLLIElement>(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <Card ref={cardRef}></Card>
      <ListItem ref={listItemRef}></ListItem>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Chakra UI

Chakra UI is another powerful React component library that provides a set of
functional and accessible components that you can use in your React applications. Since Chakra UI v3, you can install individual components instead
of installing the whole library like MUI or Bootstrap.

For example, to install the `Button` component, you can run:

```sh
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add
chakra snippet add button
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { HStack } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <HStack wrap="wrap" gap="6">
      <Button size="xs">Button (xs)</Button>
      <Button size="sm">Button (sm)</Button>
      <Button size="md">Button (md)</Button>
      <Button size="lg">Button (lg)</Button>
      <Button size="xl">Button (xl)</Button>
    </HStack>
  )
}
```

# CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS is a technique for writing CSS inside your JavaScript/TypeScript code,
instead of being defined in a separate CSS file.

## Inline CSS-in-JS

Inline CSS-in-JS is the most basic form of CSS-in-JS. You can use the `style`
attribute in your JSX to style your components.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";

const styles = {
  color: "red",
  backgroundColor: "blue",
};

const App = () => {
  return <div style={styles}>Hello World</div>;
};
```

## Styled-components

[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write rich CSS styles with features like theming, props-based styling, responsive and more in your React components, which are not
possible with inline CSS-in-JS.

```jsx showLineNumbers
const StyledButton = styled.button<{ $primary?: boolean; }>`
  /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
  background: ${props => props.$primary ? "#BF4F74" : "white"};
  color: ${props => props.$primary ? "white" : "#BF4F74"};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid #BF4F74;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <StyledButton>Normal Button</StyledButton>
      <StyledButton $primary>Primary Button</StyledButton>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The problem with `styled-components` is that it adds a lot of overhead to your
applications during runtime. Many CSS-in-JS libraries like `styled-components`
or `emotion` requires converting the styles written in these components to plain
CSS and inserting them into the document at runtime. This can cause performance
issues in your applications.

## Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS

To solve the performance issues of traditional CSS-in-JS libraries, many new
libraries like [linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria) are created to
generate CSS at build time, hence there is no runtime overhead. They also solve
the problem of dynamic styles with `props` by using CSS custom properties like
CSS variables.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { styled } from "@linaria/react";
import { families, sizes } from "./fonts";

// Write your styles in `styled` tag
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-family: ${families.serif};
`;

const Container = styled.div`
  font-size: ${sizes.medium}px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
  border: 1px solid red;

  &:hover {
    border-color: blue;
  }

  ${Title} {
    margin-bottom: 24px;
  }
`;

const App = () => (
  <Container color="#333">
  <Title>Hello world</Title>
</Container>;
);
```

# TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) belongs to a different category than the
previous ones. First, it is a utility-first class CSS framework, which means it
provides a set of utility classes that you can include in your React
components. Unlike writing CSS rules in the traditional way, you can just write
classes in your elements like this:

```jsx showLineNumbers
<figure class="md:flex bg-slate-100 rounded-xl p-8 md:p-0 dark:bg-slate-800">
  <img class="w-24 h-24 md:w-48 md:h-auto md:rounded-none rounded-full mx-auto" src="/sarah-dayan.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="512">
  <div class="pt-6 md:p-8 text-center md:text-left space-y-4">
    <blockquote>
      <p class="text-lg font-medium">
        “Tailwind CSS is the only framework that I've seen scale
        on large teams. It’s easy to customize, adapts to any design,
        and the build size is tiny.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="font-medium">
      <div class="text-sky-500 dark:text-sky-400">
        Sarah Dayan
      </div>
      <div class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-500">
        Staff Engineer, Algolia
      </div>
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>
```

It feels like writing inline CSS, but unlike inline CSS styles, TailwindCSS
supports media queries, pseudo-classes, and more.

You can also set your arbitrary values in your Tailwind classes:

```jsx disableCopyButton
<div class="top-[117px]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Or you can write your own CSS classes with TailwindCSS:

```css
.select2-dropdown {
  @apply rounded-b-lg shadow-md;
}
.select2-search {
  @apply border border-gray-300 rounded;
}
.select2-results__group {
  @apply text-lg font-bold text-gray-900;
}
```

The way TailwindCSS works is that it will scan your HTML and JavaScript
components for classnames, generate a CSS file with all the utility classes with
optimization and write a static CSS files with zero runtime.


# Headless components

Headless components are recently introduced in the React community as an
opposite way to UI libraries. Instead of focusing on building a beautiful UI,
headless components tend to focus the functionality and the logic of the
components and let you write your own styles.

## Radix UI

[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/) is a collection of headless UI components that
allows you to install what you need, instead of installing the whole UI library
like MUI and having many components that you never touch.

The way Radix UI works is that it creates a component that lives inside your
projects, usually in the `components` folder or the folder of your choice.

For example, to install a dropdown component, you can run:

```sh
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
```

Then you can simply use that component in your project:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import * as DropdownMenu from "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger />

		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>
				<DropdownMenu.Label />
				<DropdownMenu.Item />

				<DropdownMenu.Group>
					<DropdownMenu.Item />
				</DropdownMenu.Group>

				<DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem>
					<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator />
				</DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem>

				<DropdownMenu.RadioGroup>
					<DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
						<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator />
					</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
				</DropdownMenu.RadioGroup>

				<DropdownMenu.Sub>
					<DropdownMenu.SubTrigger />
					<DropdownMenu.Portal>
						<DropdownMenu.SubContent />
					</DropdownMenu.Portal>
				</DropdownMenu.Sub>

				<DropdownMenu.Separator />
				<DropdownMenu.Arrow />
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

Radix UI provides a set of powerful components that implements the behaviors in
according components very well. They make you less worry about the actual logics
and behaviors. You can just focus on the styles and the design of the components.

![Headless components](/pedro-slides-on-dropdown.png)

<small>A slide from Pedro Duarte's talk at Next.js conf in 2021. Pedro is one of the creators of Radix UI, and here he describes how much time it took them to implement a fully accessible dropdown menu that works well in all browsers and supports all screen readers.</small>

## ShadCN

[ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is another headless UI library that works very
similar to Radix UI. In fact, ShadCN is built on top of Radix UI and includes
TailwindCSS classes to complete the components.

As Radix UI, you can install individual components as you need:

```sh
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Then you can use the component in your project:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

ShadCN also provides much more complex UI components that utilize powerful
engines of other libraries. For example, the [drawer component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/drawer)
is built on top of another package called [vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul)
and includes the TailwindCSS classes as styles.

## Headless UI

[Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) is another headless UI library. Unlike
Radix UI and ShadCN, Headless UI is a set of completely unstyled,
fully-integrated with TailwindCSS. The nice thing about Headless UI is that it
focuses on the accessibility and the most commonly-used components like
modals, popovers, and dropdowns. Or like many people, they use Headless UI with
TailwindCSS to create their own unified design system, instead of having raw
classname strings in the reusable components.

To use Headless UI, you can install the package:

```sh
npm install @headlessui/react
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Button } from '@headlessui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Button className="rounded bg-sky-600 py-2 px-4 text-sm text-white data-[hover]:bg-sky-500 data-[active]:bg-sky-700">
      Save changes
    </Button>
  )
}
```

# Conclusion

Choosing the right CSS techniques for your site is a hard question. If you are
new, it's best to try them all to see which one fits your needs. Maybe you want
to learn CSS, then writing your own CSS is a good choice. Maybe you want to have
your applications out in the market as soon as possible, then using a UI library
like MUI sounds better.

Personally, I prefer using TailwindCSS for styling and ShadCN components for
behaviors. The only reason is that I don't want to break down my components into
smaller parts and think about naming them. I also want to look at individual
components and have grasp of what they look like, instead of finding their CSS
styles somewhere. But that's just me. You can choose your own way.
