[ShikiJS](https://shiki.style/) is the most popular code syntax highlighter. But how do you integrate it into your Next.JS project?

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

[ShikiJS](https://shiki.style/) is a powerful code syntax highlighter based on
TextMate Grammar, which is the same engine that powers VSCode. ShikiJS has been
used in many popular projects such as [NextJS landing page](https://nextjs.org/),
and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). In this post, we will dive into how to use
ShikiJS and integrate it into NextJS and MDX ecosystem.

# Why ShikiJS?

There are some existing syntax highlighters that are well supported and powerful
such as [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/),
[HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/). However, these are designed to run in
the browser. ShikiJS takes a different approach called **highlighting ahead of
time**. Instead of shipping raw code content to the browswer then highlighting
it, ShikiJS will ship the highlighted code content as HTML to the browswer. This
is a more efficient approach for static site generators and server-rendering
like NextJS.

I'm using ShikiJS for this project, which is written in NextJS and MDX. You can
inspect the source code of this page to see how it works.

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

# How to use Shiki in Next with MDX


Markdown is a popular format for writing content. It's a markup language like
HTML, but it provides a more lightweight, simpler set of rules for formatting
text. Most static sites use Markdown to write content.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a superset of Markdown that allows you to use JSX
inside Markdown. Sometimes you want to include some specific, custom components
such as charts, code blocks or interactive elements which Markdown does not
support.

NextJS supports MDX very well. You can use the official `@next/mdx` package to
render MDX content from local files. With this pattern, it allows you to write
pages in Markdown or MDX in `/pages` (Page Router) or `/app` (App Router)
directory just like how you write pages in React.

Another way is to use a third-party package called `next-mdx-remote`. Unlike
`@next/mdx`, `next-mdx-remote` allows you to render MDX content from remote
sources such as a CMS or a database, or even from a file system by using
`node:fs`. If you want to locate all your MDX files in a specific directory, not
in NextJS directory patterns, `next-mdx-remote` is a good choice. For
simplicity, I will use `next-mdx-remote` and the App Router pattern in this
post.

## Set up

NextJS has [a solution](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-portfolio)
for creating a blog website using App Router and MDX. You can use this template
to visualize how it works. First, create a new NextJS project with the following
command:

```ansi
[0;34mnpx[0;0m create-next-app --example [0;33mhttps://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog[0;0m shiki-mdx-next-app

...

[0;32mSuccess![0;0m Created shiki-mdx-next-app at shiki-mdx-next-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  [0;34mnpm run dev[0;0m
    Starts the development server.

  [0;34mnpm run build[0;0m
    Builds the app for production.

  [0;34mnpm start[0;0m
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  [0;34mcd[0;0m shiki-mdx-next-app
  [0;34mnpm run dev[0;0m
```

*You can replace `shiki-mdx-next-app` with your project name.*

This package has already included essential packages and configurations for MDX
and App Router pattern.

You can run the development server with `npm run dev` and open the browser to
`http://localhost:3000` to see the result.

## Install ShikiJS and its dependencies

Shiki contains many packages to work and integrate with different frameworks.

- [`shiki`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shiki) &mdash; Shiki Core Engine
Package.
- [`@shikijs/rehype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shikijs/rehype) &mdash;
Rehype Plugin for Shiki
- [`@shikijs/transformers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shikijs/transformers)
&mdash; Common Transformers for Shiki.

Let's install these packages:

```ansi
[0;34mnpm[0;0m install -D shiki @shikijs/rehype @shikijs/transformers
```

You did not mistake. Shiki dependencies are suggested to be installed as dev
dependencies. This is because Shiki will be used in development mode only.
During runtime, Shiki will not be used therefore, it's not necessary to include
Shiki in the production build.

## Create a fine-grained Bundle

Shiki comes with a full bundle, which allows you to use all the supported themes
and languages. However, this bundle can be quite large and unnecessary. However,
you can create a fine-grained bundle[^1] that explicitly loads themes and
languages you specify.

Create a `lib` directory in the `/app` directory. Then, create a new file called
`shiki.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="lib/shiki.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createHighlighterCore } from "shiki/core";
import { createOnigurumaEngine } from "shiki/engine-oniguruma.mjs";
import githubDark from "shiki/themes/github-dark.mjs";
import githubLight from "shiki/themes/github-light.mjs";
import javascriptLang from "shiki/langs/javascript.mjs";
import cssLang from "shiki/langs/css.mjs";
import graphqlLang from "shiki/langs/graphql.mjs";
import pythonLang from "shiki/langs/python.mjs";
import shellLang from "shiki/langs/shellscript.mjs";
import protobufLang from "shiki/langs/protobuf.mjs";

import wasm from "shiki/wasm";

/**
 * Create a Shiki core highlighter instance, with no languages or themes
 * bundled. Wasm and each language and theme must be loaded manually.
 */
const highlighter = createHighlighterCore({
  // Specify the themes you want to use. You can include as many as you want.
  // See https://shiki.style/themes for a list of available themes.
  themes: [githubDark, githubLight],

  // Specify the languages you want to use. You can include as many
  // as you want.
  langs: [
    javascriptLang,
    cssLang,
    graphqlLang,
    pythonLang,
    shellLang,
    protobufLang,
  ],

  // Default grammar parser. This is reccomended for most use cases. You can
  // also use your own custom engine.
  // See https://shiki.style/guide/regex-engines#oniguruma-engine
  engine: createOnigurumaEngine(wasm),
});

export default highlighter;
```

## Use rehype plugins

The way Shiki works is to parse the code string directly and return the HTML
content. For example:

```js displayLineNumbers="false" allowCopy="false"
await highlighter.codeToHtml('console.log("Hello World")', {
  lang: 'javascript',
  theme: 'github-dark',
});
```

However, it is tedious to manually parse the code string in every code block in
every MDX file. This is where `@shikijs/rehype` comes in. This plugin will be
used by `next-mdx-remote` to parse the code string in the MDX file and return the HTML content automatically.

Go to the `app/components/mdx.tsx` file and modify it as follow:

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
// Other imports ...
import { highlight } from "sugar-high"; // [!code --]
import rehypeShikiFromHighlighter, { // [!code ++]
  type RehypeShikiCoreOptions, // [!code ++]
} from "@shikijs/rehype/core"; // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
import shikiHighlighter from "../lib/shiki"; // [!code ++]

// Other components ...

function Code({ children, ...props }) { // [!code --]
  let codeHTML = highlight(children) // [!code --]
  return <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: codeHTML }} {...props} /> // [!code --]
} // [!code --]

let components = {
  h1: createHeading(1),
  h2: createHeading(2),
  h3: createHeading(3),
  h4: createHeading(4),
  h5: createHeading(5),
  h6: createHeading(6),
  Image: RoundedImage,
  code: Code, // [!code --]
  a: CustomLink,
  Table,
};

export function CustomMDX(props) { // [!code --]
export async function CustomMDX(props) { // [!code ++]
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={{ // [!code ++]
        mdxOptions: { // [!code ++]
          format: "mdx", // [!code ++]
          rehypePlugins: [ // [!code ++]
            [ // [!code ++]
              rehypeShikiFromHighlighter, // [!code ++]
              await shikiHighlighter, // [!code ++]
              { // [!code ++]
                themes: { // [!code ++]
                  dark: "github-dark", // [!code ++]
                  light: "github-light", // [!code ++]
                }, // [!code ++]
              } as RehypeShikiCoreOptions, // [!code ++]
            ], // [!code ++]
          ], // [!code ++]
        }, // [!code ++]
      }} // [!code ++]
    />
  );
}
```

What we did here:

- Remove `Code` component and remove `highlight` from `sugar-high` package since
  we will use `@shikijs/rehype` to parse the code string.
- Add `rehypeShikiFromHighlighter` from `@shikijs/rehype` package to
  `rehypePlugins` array in the `CustomMDX` component. See [rehype with
  fine-grained bundle](https://shiki.style/packages/rehype#fine-grained-bundle)
  for more information.
- Update `CustomMDX` component to be an `async` component and use `await` for
  `shikiHighlighter`.

Let's create a simple code block in the `index.mdx` file to test the syntax
highlighting:

~~~mdx title="how-to-use-shiki-in-next-with-mdx.mdx" showLineNumbers
{/* Other content */}
```ansi
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog shiki-mdx-next-app

...

Success! Created shiki-mdx-next-app at shiki-mdx-next-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd shiki-mdx-next-app
  npm run dev
```
~~~

The result will look like this:

![MDX No Style](/mdx-no-style.png)

# Adding dual themes

By default, Shiki will use the light theme you specify in the rehype options.
It's not that Shiki does not include the dark theme, but it does not include
the CSS style for dark theme. In order to use the dark theme, you need to add
your own CSS style for that.

In NextJS projects, you can use either class or media query to switch between
light and dark themes. Here is an example of how to add a dark theme with class
in the `app/globals.css` file:

```css title="app/globals.css" showLineNumbers
/* For dark mode using query */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .shiki,
  .shiki span {
    color: var(--shiki-dark) !important;
    background-color: var(--shiki-dark-bg) !important;
    /* Optional, if you also want font styles */
    font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style) !important;
    font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight) !important;
    text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration) !important;
  }
}
```

For more information about how to add dual themes, see [ShikiJS's Official Dual
Theme Guide](https://shiki.style/guide/dual-themes).

With that change, now our code block looks better in dark mode:

![MDX With Dark Theme](/mdx-with-dark-theme.png)

Or on light mode:

![MDX With Light Theme](/mdx-with-light-theme.png)

# Custom code block component

Often, you want to customize the code block component to include certain
features such as title, line numbers, or copy button. In order to do that, you
need to intercept the component rendering via `components` prop in the
`MDXRemote`.

Traditionally, `next-mdx-remote` does not parse the code block in the MDX files.
It passes the raw code string to the native `pre` and `code` HTML elements.

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
let components = {
  // other components
  pre: (props) => {
    console.log(props);

    return <pre {...props} />;
  },
};

export async function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
    />
  );
}
```

For example, this simple code block:

~~~js displayLineNumbers="false" allowCopy="false"
await highlighter.codeToHtml('console.log("Hello World")', {
  lang: 'javascript',
  theme: 'github-dark',
});
~~~

will produce the following output:

```js
{
  children: {
    '$$typeof': Symbol(react.element),
    type: 'code',
    key: null,
    ref: null,
    props: {
      className: 'language-js',
      children: `await highlighter.codeToHtml('console.log("Hello World")', {\n` +
        "  lang: 'javascript',\n" +
        "  theme: 'github-dark',\n" +
        '});\n'
    },
    _owner: null,
    _store: {}
  }
}
```

Then you can use React components to intercept the code string and parse it with
tools such as PrismJS, or HighlightJS to create your own code block component.

However, Shiki Rehype Plugin will parse the code string and modify the `pre` and
`code` HTML elements to include the highlighted HTML content. Therefore, you
don't need to handle the parsing process.


```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
export async function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={{ // [!code ++]
        mdxOptions: { // [!code ++]
          format: "mdx", // [!code ++]
          rehypePlugins: [ // [!code ++]
            [ // [!code ++]
              rehypeShikiFromHighlighter, // [!code ++]
              await shikiHighlighter, // [!code ++]
              { // [!code ++]
                themes: { // [!code ++]
                  dark: "github-dark", // [!code ++]
                  light: "github-light", // [!code ++]
                }, // [!code ++]
              } as RehypeShikiCoreOptions, // [!code ++]
            ], // [!code ++]
          ], // [!code ++]
        }, // [!code ++]
      }} // [!code ++]
    />
  );
}
```

With the same code block, the terminal output looks slightly different:

```js
{
  className: 'shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark',
  style: {
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    '--shiki-dark-bg': '#24292e',
    color: '#24292e',
    '--shiki-dark': '#e1e4e8'
  },
  tabIndex: '0',
  children: {
    '$$typeof': Symbol(react.element),
    type: 'code',
    key: null,
    ref: null,
    props: { children: [Array] },
    _owner: null,
    _store: {}
  }
}
```


<Callout title="Inspect children props" type="info">

You can inspect the `children` property further using `console.log` and
combining it with functions like `JSON.stringify` or `util.inspect` to see the
full content.

</Callout>

After inspecting the `props`, you can select which one you want to use in your
final code block, or you can just pass the `props` directly to the `pre` with
spreading operator `{...props}`.

For example:

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
let components = {
  pre: (props) => {
    console.log(props);

    return <CustomPre {...props} />
  },
};
```

```tsx title="app/components/custom-pre.tsx" showLineNumbers
import * as React from "react";

import CopyButton from "./copy-button";

export interface MetaMap {
  title: string;
  lang: string | undefined;
  rawCode: string;
}

type BlogCodeProps = React.PropsWithChildren<
  React.DetailedHTMLProps<
    React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLPreElement>,
    HTMLPreElement
  > &
    MetaMap
>;

const CustomPre: React.FC<BlogCodeProps> = ({
  title,
  children,
  lang,
  rawCode,
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <pre {...rest}>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between ">
        <div>title</div>
        <CopyButton content="" />
      </div>
      <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">{children}</div>
    </pre>
  );
};

export default CustomPre;
```

```tsx title="app/components/copy-button.tsx" showLineNumbers
"use client";
import * as React from "react";

interface Props {
  content: string;
}

const CopyButton: React.FC<Props> = ({ content }) => {
  const [title, setTitle] = React.useState("Copy");
  const [timerId, setTimerId] = React.useState<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    try {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(content);
      setTitle("Copied!");

      if (timerId) {
        clearTimeout(timerId);
        setTimerId(null);
      }

      setTimerId(
        setTimeout(() => {
          setTitle("Copy");
        }, 2000)
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to copy: ", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={handleClick}
      className="px-2 py-1 rounded-lg bg-slate-500/20 hover:bg-slate-500/40 hover:cursor-pointer"
    >
      {title}
    </button>
  );
};

export default CopyButton;
```

# Parse metadata

Metadata is a common feature in Markdown and MDX files, which allows you to
specify some additional information about the content such as title, displaying
line numbers, highlighting certain lines or allowing copying content.

Typically, metadata is written in the following format:

~~~mdx
```js title="index.js" displayLineNumbers="true" allowCopy="true"
console.log('Hello World');
```
~~~

Now how you structure this metadata format is up to you. You can use it with or
without quotes, or you can use a different delimiter such as `:` or `=`. With
that said, using `=` is the most common way to separate the key and value, and
using quotes allows you to use spaces in the value.

Using the above code block with metadata, you can access the raw metadata string
during Shiki transformer hooks[^2]. For example:

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
export async function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={{
        mdxOptions: {
          format: "mdx",
          rehypePlugins: [
            [
              rehypeShikiFromHighlighter,
              await shikiHighlighter,
              {
                themes: {
                  dark: "github-dark",
                  light: "github-light",
                },
                transformers: [ // [!code ++]
                  { // [!code ++]
                    preprocess(code, options) { // [!code ++]
                      console.log("preprocess", code, options.meta); // [!code ++]
                    }, // [!code ++]
                  }, // [!code ++]
                ], // [!code ++]
              } as RehypeShikiCoreOptions,
            ],
          ],
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The output will look like this:

```
preprocess await highlighter.codeToHtml('console.log("Hello World")', {
  lang: 'javascript',
  theme: 'github-dark',
}); { __raw: 'displayLineNumbers="false" allowCopy="false"' }
```

However, we want to access the metadata as a hash map or a key-value object so
we can easily access the metadata values in other transformer hooks. Luckily,
Shiki provides a helper function called `parseMetaString`. This function will
take the raw metadata string and allows us to parse it into a key-value object.

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
interface MetaValue { // [!code ++]
  name: string; // [!code ++]
  regex: RegExp; // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
export interface MetaMap { // [!code ++]
  title: string; // [!code ++]
  displayLineNumbers: boolean | undefined; // [!code ++]
  allowCopy: boolean | undefined; // [!code ++]
  lang: string | undefined; // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
const metaValues: MetaValue[] = [ // [!code ++]
  { // [!code ++]
    name: "title", // [!code ++]
    regex: /title="(?<value>[^"]*)"/, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  { // [!code ++]
    name: "lang", // [!code ++]
    regex: /lang="(?<value>[^"]*)"/, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  { // [!code ++]
    name: "displayLineNumbers", // [!code ++]
    regex: /displayLineNumbers="(?<value>true|false)"/, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  { // [!code ++]
    name: "allowCopy", // [!code ++]
    regex: /allowCopy="(?<value>true|false)"/, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
]; // [!code ++]

export async function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={{
        mdxOptions: {
          format: "mdx",

            [

              await shikiHighlighter,
              {
                themes: {
                  // Other themes
                },
                parseMetaString(metaString) { // [!code ++]
                  const map: MetaMap = { // [!code ++]

                  }; // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
                  for (const value of metaValues) { // [!code ++]
                    const result = value.regex.exec(metaString); // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
                    if (result && value.name === "title") { // [!code ++]
                      map.title = result?.groups?.value || ""; // [!code ++]
                    } // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
                    if (result && value.name === "displayLineNumbers") { // [!code ++]
                      map.displayLineNumbers = result.groups?.value === "true"; // [!code ++]
                    } // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
                    if (result && value.name === "allowCopy") { // [!code ++]
                      map.allowCopy = result.groups?.value === "true"; // [!code ++]
                    } // [!code ++]
                  } // [!code ++]
­  // [!code ++]
                  return map; // [!code ++]
                }, // [!code ++]
                transformers: [
                  {
                    preprocess(code, options) {
                      console.log("preprocess", code, options.meta);
                    },
                  },
                ],
              } as RehypeShikiCoreOptions,
            ],
          ],
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The `parseMetaString` function will append the metadata object to the `options`
object in the transformer hook cycle. You can access the metadata object by using `options.meta` in the transformer hooks such as `preprocess`.

```js
{
  title: '',
  displayLineNumbers: false,
  allowCopy: false,
  lang: 'txt',
  __raw: 'displayLineNumbers="false" allowCopy="false"'
}
```

Then you can pass the metadata object into your `CustomPre` component:

```tsx title="app/components/custom-pre.tsx" showLineNumbers
const CustomPre: React.FC<BlogCodeProps> = ({
  title,
  children,
  lang,
  rawCode,
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <pre {...rest}>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between ">
        <div>{title}</div> // [!code ++]
        <CopyButton content="" />
      </div>
      <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">{children}</div>
    </pre>
  );
};
```

# Query the language

You might have noticed that the `lang` metadata is not set properly. Obiviously,
the code block is written in JavaScript, but the `lang` metadata is set to `txt`.

This is because the `lang` is not considered as a metadata in the code block but
it is a part of the MDX code block. In order to access the lananguage used in
code blocks, you can reference to `options.lang` in the transformer hooks.

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx"
transformers: [
  {
    preprocess(code, options) { // [!code ++]
      const optionsMeta = options.meta as MetaMap; // [!code ++]
      optionsMeta.lang = options.lang || "txt"; // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
    // other hooks
  },
],
```

Now the `lang` metadata will be set to `javascript`:

```ansi
{
  title: '',
  displayLineNumbers: false,
  allowCopy: false,
  lang: 'js',
  __raw: 'displayLineNumbers="false" allowCopy="false"'
}
```

**The `lang` metadata does not effect anything about parsing**. It's merely an
an additional property that you can use in your custom code block component such
as adding a language icon, or displaying the language name in the code block.
For example, we can add the default title to the `lang` metadata if the `title`
is missing:

```tsx title="app/components/custom-pre.tsx" showLineNumbers
const CustomPre: React.FC<BlogCodeProps> = ({
  title,
  children,
  lang,
  rawCode,
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <pre {...rest}>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <div>{title && title.length > 0 ? title : lang}</div> // [!code ++]
        <CopyButton content="" />
      </div>
      <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">{children}</div>
    </pre>
  );
};
```

# Copy button

Copy button is a common feature in writing code blocks. It allows users to copy
the raw code content to the clipboard. A simple and secure way to implement this
feature is to use the `navigator.clipboard` API as we did in the `CopyButton`
component.

However, this API only works with strings. Since Shiki returns the highlighted
HTML content, we cannot use `children` props directly. But thanks to transformer
hook `preprocess`, we can access the raw code content and pass it as a metadata.

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx"
transformers: [
  {
    preprocess(code, options) {
      const optionsMeta = options.meta as MetaMap;
      optionsMeta.lang = options.lang || "txt";
      optionsMeta.rawCode = code; // [!code ++]
    },
    // other hooks
  },
],
```

Now, you can use the `rawCode` metadata to pass the raw code content to the
`CopyButton` component.

```tsx title="app/components/custom-pre.tsx" showLineNumbers
const CustomPre: React.FC<BlogCodeProps> = ({
  title,
  children,
  lang,
  rawCode,
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <pre {...rest}>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between ">
        <div>{title && title.length > 0 ? title : lang}</div>
        <CopyButton content={rawCode} /> // [!code ++]
      </div>
      <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">{children}</div>
    </pre>
  );
};
```

# Transformer hooks

We have been mentioning the term *transformer hooks* throughout this post but
never really explain what it is. Transformer hooks are a set of functions that
allow you to intercept the parsing process of the code block.

## Builtin transformer hooks

Shiki provides a set of builtin transformer hooks that you can use to customize
the parsing process. ShikiJS provides the list of builtin transformer hooks
[here](https://shiki.matsu.io/packages/transformers)

## Custom transformer hooks

You can also create your own custom transformer hooks for your specific use
case. A common case while writing MDX code blocks is to add line numbers.
However, Shiki does not provide a transfomer hook for such feature. But you can
create it by yourself.

There are many ways to create such feature. You can intercept deepyly into the
HTML content and add the line numbers manually. Or you can follow the best
practice that Shiki transformer hooks follow, which is to add a CSS class to the
HTML content. For simplicty, we are going to use the latter approach.

```tsx title="app/components/mdx.tsx" showLineNumbers
export async function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={{
        mdxOptions: {
          // Other options
          rehypePlugins: [
            // Other plugins
            [
              rehypeShikiFromHighlighter,
              await shikiHighlighter,
              {
                // code configurations
                transformers: [
                  // Other transformers
                  {
                    // Other hooks
                    line(node, line) { // [!code ++]
                      node.properties["class"] = `${node.properties["class"]} line-number`; // [!code ++]
                    }, // [!code ++]
                  },
                ],
              } as RehypeShikiCoreOptions,
            ],
          ],
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The HTML output will look like this:

```html
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark" style="background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#24292e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#e1e4e8" tabindex="0">
  <div class="flex items-center justify-between ">
    <div>shiki.ts</div>
    <button class="px-2 py-1 rounded-lg bg-slate-500/20 hover:bg-slate-500/40 hover:cursor-pointer">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <div class="w-full overflow-x-auto">
    <code>
      <span class="line has-line-number">...</span>
      <span class="line has-line-number">...</span>
      <span class="line has-line-number">...</span>
      <span class="line has-line-number">...</span>
      <span class="line has-line-number">...</span>
      <!-- other lines -->
    </code>
  </div>
</pre>
```

Now, it's up to you on how you want to style using this CSS class. An example of
that is to use `counter` and `content` CSS properties to add line numbers.

```css title="app/globals.css"
.prose pre {
  @apply bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-900 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-900 py-2 px-3 text-sm;
  @apply [counter-reset:_line];
}

.prose pre .line.has-line-number:before {
  @apply content-[counter(_line)] [counter-increment:_line] text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-600;
  @apply mr-2 w-4 inline-block text-right; // [!code ++]
}
```

You can also combine the metadata with this feature to opt your code blocks in or out displaying line numbers.

# Conclusion

Shiki is a powerful syntax highlighter that can be integrated very well into the
Next.JS and MDX ecosystem. With the help of `@shikijs/rehype` and
`@shikijs/transformers`, you can easily parse the code string in the MDX files,
customize the code block component, and add additional features to make your
code blocks more interactive and more informative.

With that said, Shiki contains many drawbacks. First, it uses a lot of memory
and CPU resources to parse the code string. Secondly, it requires you to create
a decent stategy for caching Shiki instances on hot reloading[^3]. Finally, if
you need something to work in the browser, it's getting tricky to use Shiki in
such cases.

There are many packages that help you integrate Shiki with MDX and NextJS such
as [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/). These packages use
Shiki under the hood to save you from the complexity of configuration while
still provide you better, more fine-grained control over how to customize the
code blocks.
