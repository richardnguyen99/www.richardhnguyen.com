Iterator pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to access the
underlying elements of a collection without exposing its internal
implementation. Many data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and
graphs can be traversed using the iterator pattern. This pattern is widely
adopted in many programming languages like Java, C++, and Python.
