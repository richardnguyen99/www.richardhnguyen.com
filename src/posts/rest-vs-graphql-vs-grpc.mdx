Understand how REST, GraphQL, and gRPC differ from each other and choose which
one is best for building highly-scalable APIs.

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

REST (Representational State Transfer) has been the industrial-standard
architectural style for building web APIs. In 2023, 86% of APIs are RESTful
[^1]. Later, GraphQL was introduced by the FaceBook team as a solution to a
more efficient data fetching problem in mobile applications. And now, gRPC has
gained its notoriety as a highly-efficient protocol for handling internal
applications in microservice architectures.

# REST

REST is the most common architectural style for building APIs. A common
misconception is that REST is a framework or a library, but in fact, it is not.
REST utilizes the HTTP protocol to define a set of constraints that allow
clients to communicate with servers. However, the definition of the constraints
are vague and up to the developers.

![Simple REST Illustration](/simple-rest-illustration.png "Simple REST Illustration")

## REST Constraints

REST uses URLs as endpoints to define resources and HTTP methods to perform
actions on those resources. Here are some of the common HTTP methods:

- `GET`: For fetching or retrieving data from a resource.
- `POST`: For creating a new entity in a resource.
- `PUT`: For updating an existing entity in a resource.
- `DELETE`: For deleting an entity in a resource.

An endpoint can have multiple methods and each method can define the action to
be performed on the resource. For example, a endpoint `/users/[id]` can have:

- `GET`: Fetch user by the user ID.
- `PUT`: Update user by the user ID.
- `DELETE`: Delete user by the user ID.


## Communication

As mentioned above, REST is built on top of the HTTP protocol. All the data is
transferred by plain text and does not have any standard schema. The
requirements and the structure of the data should be agreed upon by the client
and the server.

With that said, REST commonly uses structured-data formats like JSON or XML to
transfer data. JSON is the most popular format due to its simplicity and
friendliness with many programming languages.

For example, a `GET` request to fetch a user by ID can be defined in the server:

```py
# Example in Python + Flask
@app.route('/users/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(id):
    user = User.query.get(id)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```

Clients can consume this endpoint in other languages like JavaScript:

```js
fetch('/users/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

Or using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (GUI-based) or [curl](https://curl.se/) (terminal-based).

```ansi
[0;34mcurl[0;0m -X GET [4;33mhttp://localhost:5000/users/1[0;0m
```

## Pros and Cons

One major advantage of REST is its simplicity. Most programming languages have
libraries to create and interact with RESTful APIs. Developers can choose how
they want to implement and structure their API endpoints. REST is also friendly
to communicating between external services.

However, REST has some drawbacks. One of the most common issues is over-fetching
data. Over-fetching is when the client receives more data than it needs, which can be a waste of bandwidth. Another issue is under-fetching, where the client needs to make multiple requests to get all the data it needs.

Another major issue with REST is the number of endpoints. As the application grows, the number of endpoints can grow exponentially, making it harder to maintain and understand the API. The number of endpoints can also lead to versioning issues, where the client needs to know which version of the API to use.

With development perspective, REST also doesn't have a type-checking mechanism
to validate the types of the data being sent or received. Developers have no
guarantee that the data being sent or received is correct. Checking and
validating requires manual work, either writing tests or using external tools
such as middlewares and validators.

# GraphQL

GraphQL was introduced later by the Facebook team as a solution to solve these
problems with REST. The main goal of GraphQL is to provide a more efficient way
to fetch data in mobile applications, where bandwidth and performance are
critical. Instead of making multiple requests to fetch data, the client can
specify exactly what data it needs in a single request.

## Query Language

GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It allows clients to specify exactly what
data they need.

Let's take a look at a simple example of fetching authors and their songs in a
mobile application. The client needs to fetch the data for an author given an
author ID and all the songs that the author has featured.

With REST, the client needs to make multiple requests to fetch the data:

```py
# Example in Python + Flask
@app.route('/authors/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_author(id):
    author = Author.query.get(id)
    return jsonify(author.to_dict())
```

```py
@app.route('/authors/<int:id>/songs', methods=['GET'])
def get_author_songs(id):
    songs = Song.query.filter_by(author_id=id).all()
    return jsonify([song.to_dict() for song in songs])
```

However, with GraphQL, the client can fetch all the data in a single request
with the help of GraphQL query language:

```graphql showLineNumbers
query AuthorQuery {
  author(id: <author_id>) {
    id
    name
    songs {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

![REST vs GraphQL in Client Calls](/rest-vs-graphql-client-call-illustration.png "REST vs GraphQL in Client Calls")

## Communication

Unlike REST, which uses URLs and HTTP methods to define the endpoints and their
associated actions, GraphQL uses a single endpoint called `/graphql` with HTTP
method `POST` to handle all the requests.

![Simple GraphQL Illustration](/simple-graphql-illustration.png "Simple GraphQL Illustration")

The communication between the client and the server is done through the GraphQL
query language. The server will define a schema that describes the entities and
the relationships between them.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  songs: [Song!]!
}

type Song {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  releaseDate: Date!
}

# Query to fetch an author and their songs
type Query {
  author(id: ID!): Author
  song(id: ID!): Song
}

# Mutation (side-effect operations) to create a new record
type Mutation {
  createAuthor(name: String!): Author
  createSong(title: String!, releaseDate: Date!): Song
}
```

The client can write a query to fetch the exact data it needs:

```graphql showLineNumbers
query AuthorQuery {
  author(id: <author_id>) {
    id
    name
    songs {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}

mutation CreateAuthor {
  createAuthor(name: "John Doe") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

In the server, the query will be resolved by the server's resolver functions, as
long as the application is written in a language that supports GraphQL.

```js showLineNumbers
import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString } from 'graphql';

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: "Query",
    fields: {
      author: {
        type: AuthorType,
        args: {
          id: { type: GraphQLString }
        },
        resolve: (parent, args) => {
          // Fetch author by ID implementation
        }
      },
      song: {
        type: SongType,
        args: {
          id: { type: GraphQLString }
        },
        resolve: (parent, args) => {
          // Fetch song by ID implementation
        }
      }
    }
  }),
});
```

In order to make query calls to the server, the client can use libraries like
[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) or
[Relay](https://relay.dev/), which provide a set of powerful tools to interact
and manage the GraphQL queries more efficiently. However, a much more simple
way to write queries is to utilize the HTTP `POST` method. With this method,
you can write queries in any programming language that supports HTTP requests.

As mentioned above, GraphQL uses HTTP `POST` method to handle all the requests.
The reason why `POST` is used instead of other methods is because `POST` methods
allow the client to send a request with a body, which can contain the query.

With terminal-based tools like `curl`, you can send a GraphQL query to the
server:

```ansi
[0;34mcurl[0m -X POST [4;33mhttp://localhost:5000/graphql[0m \
  -H [0;33m"Content-Type: application/json"[0m \
  -d [0;33m'{"query": "query AuthorQuery { author(id: 1) { id name songs { id title } } }"}'[0m
```

You can directly write the query in any programming language that supports HTTP
requests. For example, in Python:

```py showLineNumbers
import requests

query = """
query AuthorQuery {
  author(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    songs {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
"""

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/graphql',
                          json={'query': query},
                          headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})

print(response.json())
```

## Pros and Cons

GraphQL has many advantages over REST. One of the main advantages is that the
client can specify exactly what data it needs in a single request. This can
reduce the number of requests the client needs to make to fetch the data it
needs. This can also reduce the amount of data the client needs to fetch, which
can improve performance.

Another advantage of GraphQL is that it supports complex queries with nesting
and conditions. This can make it easier for the client to fetch the data it
needs.

However, GraphQL also has some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it
can be more complex to set up and maintain than REST. This is because GraphQL
requires the server to define a schema that describes the entities and the
resolvers to support queries and mutations. Alongside with HTTP, backend
developers also need to get familiar with GraphQL terminologies, and the
framework they are using.

From a development perspective, GraphQL does not support other programming
languages very well, except JavaScript. So when using GraphQL, you will likely
need to use JavaScript to get the most out of it.

# gRPC

gRPC is the latest framework from Google for building APIs. It is designed to be
a high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework in a microservices
architecture.

![Simple gRPC Illustration](/simple-grpc-illustration.png "Simple gRPC Illustration")

## Protocol Buffers

Like GraphQL, gRPC uses a language called [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to define the schema of the entities and the services. Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

Using protocol buffers, gRPC can generate boilerplate code for the client and the server to communicate. It's a contract-based communication, where the client and the server agree on the schema and the services.

An example of a protocol buffer definition for a simple service:

```proto title="helloworld.proto" showLineNumbers
syntax = "proto3";

package helloworld;

// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}

  rpc SayHelloStreamReply (HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

## Communication

Unlike REST and GraphQL, gRPC exclusively uses HTTP/2 for communication. HTTP/2
is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. It
supports binary data transfer, which makes it more efficient than HTTP/1.1,
which is used in REST and GraphQL.

In order to communicate, both clients and servers need to implement the gRPC
protocol. The server will define the services and the schema using protocol
buffers, and the client will generate the client code using the protocol buffer
definition.

gRPC does not use URLs or HTTP methods to define the endpoints and the actions.
Instead, it uses the service name and the method name to define the actions.
These implementation details are abstracted away from the client, and the
developers can implement the rest based on the generated code. For example,

```js title="server.js" showLineNumbers
// generated code from the protocol buffers definition
var messages = require('./helloworld_pb');
var services = require('./helloworld_grpc_pb');

var grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');

/**
 * Implements the SayHello RPC method.
 */
function sayHello(call, callback) {
  var reply = new messages.HelloReply();
  reply.setMessage('Hello ' + call.request.getName());
  callback(null, reply);
}
```

The client also needs to generate the client code from the protocol buffers.

```js title="client.js" showLineNumbers
// generated code from the protocol buffers definition
var messages = require('./helloworld_pb');
var services = require('./helloworld_grpc_pb');

var grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');

var client = new services.GreeterClient("localhost:5005",
                                        grpc.credentials.createInsecure());
var request = new messages.HelloRequest();
var user;
if (argv._.length > 0) {
  user = argv._[0];
} else {
  user = 'world';
}
request.setName(user);
client.sayHello(request, function(err, response) {
  console.log('Greeting:', response.getMessage());
});
```

## Pros and Cons

gRPC has many advantages over REST and GraphQL. One of the main advantages is
that it is designed to be a high performance RPC framework. It uses HTTP/2 for
communication, which supports binary data transfer and multiplexing. This can
make gRPC more efficient than REST and GraphQL, which use HTTP/1.1.

Another advantage of gRPC is that it is designed to be a contract-based
framework. The client and the server agree on the schema and the services using
protocol buffers. This can make the applications more robust and easier to
maintain.

However, gRPC also has some drawbacks. One of its strength is also its weakness.
Because gRPC uses HTTP/2 for communication, it can be more complex to set up and
not all services use HTTP/2[^2].

Another drawback of gRPC is that it requires both the client and the server to
implement the gRPC protocol and use protocol buffers as the main communication.
This can make it more difficult to integrate gRPC with existing services that do
not support gRPC. Due to its common share, protocol buffers are likely to stay
close to application's repositories, making it great for internal services but
not for external services.

# Summary

# How to combine them together

In practice, REST, GraphQL and gRPC can be combined together to create a robust
application that is scalable and efficient. Let's lay out the most significant
strength of these three architectures:

- REST: General-purpose APIs, easy to set up and integrate with external
  services.
- GraphQL: Single endpoint with a support of efficient complex, nested queries.
- gRPC: High performance, low latency communication between internal services.

With these strengths in mind, GraphQL is the best choice for handling
communication between the clients and the services. Instead of having multiple
endpoints, the server can have a single endpoint `/graphql` to handle all the
queries and mutations. This can reduce the number of endpoints and make it
easier to maintain and understand the API. In other words, GraphQL can be used
as a gateway to the services.

Then, the services often need to communicate with each other. User service needs
to communicate with authentication service to determine if the user is logged
in and has the permission to access the resources. In this case, gRPC can be
used to handle that communication because both ends know what exactly they need
to send and receive. This can make the communication more efficient and robust.

Finally, REST can be used to handle the communication between the apps's
services with the external services. For example, the authentication service
uses OAuth2 to authenticate the user. The authentication service needs to send a
request to the external OAuth2 of own choice. REST can be used to handle that
communication because it is easy to set up and integrate with external services.

Here is a simple illustration of how REST, GraphQL, and gRPC can be combined:

# Conclusion

REST, GraphQL and gRPC are three different architectural styles for building
applications. REST is the most common and easiest to set up, so it is
recommended for general-purpose APIs. If you just start with building APIs, REST
is always a good choice to start because it is well supported by many tools,
frameworks and communities. GraphQL is recommended for client-driven applications
where the client needs to fetch data efficiently. gRPC is a better solution for
internal services in a microservices architecture where high performance and low
latency communication is required. Moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all
solution. Therefore, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses
of each architecture and combine them together to create a robust and efficient
application.
