C build tools are essential for compiling and linking C programs. There are many
build tools available, from native programs to cross-platform tools that allow
you to build C projects on different operating systems. In this post, we will
explore some of the most popular build tools for C and how to use them.

# Introduction

Build tools are orchestration tools that automate the process of compiling and
linking source code into executable programs. They allow you to group source
files, include libraries, and define compiler flags in a configuration file.

For example, if you have a C program that consists of multiple source files and
with a complex build options such as:

```sh
gcc -DPACKAGE_NAME=\"reactor\" -DPACKAGE_TARNAME=\"reactor\" -DPACKAGE_VERSION=\"0.0.1\" -DPACKAGE_STRING=\"reactor\ 0.0.1\" -DPACKAGE_BUGREPORT=\"\" -DPACKAGE_URL=\"\" -DPACKAGE=\"reactor\" -DVERSION=\"0.0.1\" -DHAVE_STDIO_H=1 -DHAVE_STDLIB_H=1 -DHAVE_STRING_H=1 -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_STDINT_H=1 -DHAVE_STRINGS_H=1 -DHAVE_SYS_STAT_H=1 -DHAVE_SYS_TYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_UNISTD_H=1 -DSTDC_HEADERS=1 -I.    -I../include -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=c11 -fPIC -O3  -g -O2 -MT librx_la-rx_request.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/librx_la-rx_request.Tpo -c -o librx_la-rx_request.lo `test -f 'rx_request.c' || echo './'`rx_request.c
```

and imagine you have to type this command for 10 other files. It would be a
painful experience.

This is why build tools are created. They allow you to define a common pattern
that can be reused for all the source files.

# GNU Make

[`GNU Make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is one of the most popular
build tools, which controls the generation of executables and other non-source
files of a program from the program's source files. `make` uses a `Makefile` to
define a set of rules and source files to build the target executable.

## File structure

Let's take a look at a typical project that uses `make`:

```ansi disableCopyButton
using-make
├── Makefile
├── include
│   └── whois.h
└── src
    ├── whois.c
    ├── whoisclient.c
    └── whoisserver.c

3 directories, 5 files
```

Here is the content of the `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Compiler options
# gcc for C source code
CC=gcc
INCLUDEDIR=include
SRCDIR=src

# Optimized and fully warnings
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3

# For debugging and testing only
DEBUGS=-DDEBUG -g -O0

# Include directory
INCLUDE=-I./$(INCLUDEDIR)

# Short - Compile all
all: whoisserver whoisclient

# Use to debug and test. This will display some useful message and provide quick
# development. However do not use for grading as it might not cover all hidden
# bugs.
debug:
	$(CC) $(DEBUGS) $(INCLUDE) src/whoisclient.c src/whois.c -o whoisclient_debug
	$(CC) $(DEBUGS) $(INCLUDE) src/whoisserver.c src/whois.c -o whoisserver_debug

whoisclient: whois.o whoisclient.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) whoisclient.o whois.o -o whoisclient

whoisserver: whois.o whoisserver.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) whoisserver.o whois.o -o whoisserver

# Compile all the source code to object files
%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -rf *.o whoisclient whoisserver whoisclient_debug whoisserver_debug
```

## Variables

In this `Makefile`, we define some compiling variables such as `CC`, `CFLAGS`,
and `INCLUDE`. Defining these variables allows us to change only one place where
the variable is defined, and it will be applied to all the source files.

To reference a variable, you can use the syntax `$(VARIABLE_NAME)`. For example,
`$(CC)` will be replaced with `gcc` when the `make` command is executed.

## Targets

The next thing is the target. Target is defined by a rule followed by a colon.
This rule allows you to specify the desired computations to be performed.

For example, the target `debug` will compile the `whoisclient` and `whoisserver`
in debug mode. To use this target, you can run the command `make debug`.

The target `all` is preserved for the default target, which you can run by just
typing `make`. This target will run all the dependencies in the order specified.

The dependencies are targets that need to be run before the specified target.
For example, the `all` target depends on `whoisserver` and `whoisclient`. So
when you run `make`, it will run the computations defined under `whoisserver`
and `whoisclient` first. The dependencies are also computed recursively, which
means if a dependency has its own sub-dependencies, the sub-dependencies will be
computed until all the dependencies are resolved.

```ansi disableCopyButton
$ make
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -I./include -c src/whois.c -o whois.o
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -I./include -c src/whoisserver.c -o whoisserver.o
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -I./include whoisserver.o whois.o -o whoisserver
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -I./include -c src/whoisclient.c -o whoisclient.o
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -I./include whoisclient.o whois.o -o whoisclient
```

Thanks to the optimization of `make`, no target is compiled more than once.

## Advantages

Here are some advantages of using `make`:

- `make` is an language-agnostic build tool, which means you can use it for
building many different types of languages other than C.
- `make` knows how to build a target from its dependencies, which means you can
define the order of the build process.
- `make` knows how to optimize the build process by only building the files that
have changed, instead of compiling all the source files.
- `make` is more than just a build tool. It can install, uninstall, clean up,
generate files and more.

## Disadvantages

`make` is a powerful build tool and a great entry point for beginners who want
to learn how to automate the build process. However, `make` has some
disadvantages:

- `make` is exclusive to Unix-like operating systems. If you want to build your
C project on Windows, it might not be the best choice, unless you are using
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- `make` cannot check for libraries and dependencies. For example, `make` does
not have a builtin function to check if a library is installed on the system.
- `make` does support refactoring. For example, having multiple `Makefile` files
for different parts of the project is not supported natively and requires some
manual work to get it done.

# GNU Autotools

[`GNU Autotools`](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) is a collection of GNU
build tools that are designed to make packages portable to many Unix-like
systems[^1]. The Autotools create a standard unified  build system for all the
UNIX/Linux packages:


```ansi disableCopyButton
./configure && make && make install
```

The `configure` script is generated by the `autotools` and it will check for
dependencies, libraries, and headers that are required to build the project.
After the `configure` script is run successfully, a `Makefile` will be generated
with the corresponding flags, libraries, and dependencies that are required to
run the `make` command.

Although `autotools` is a big collection of tools supporting many different
stages of a build process, you only need to focus on two files: `configure.ac`
and `Makefile.am`.

## File structure

Let's reuse our implementation for `whois` project and convert it to use
`autotools`:

```ansi disableCopyButton
using-autotools
├── configure.ac
├── include
│   └── whois.h
├── Makefile.am
├── src
│   ├── Makefile.am
│   ├── whois.c
│   ├── whoisclient.c
│   └── whoisserver.c
└── README.md
```

## configure.ac

Let's take a look at the content of `configure.ac`:

```ac title="configure.ac"

    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DDEBUG -g -O0"

AC_CHECK_HEADERS([time.h],          [], [AC_MSG_ERROR([time.h not found])])

# Check for functions (if needed)

# Check for declarations (if needed)

# Check for type definitions
# Example: AC_CHECK_TYPES([type_name], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
AC_CHECK_TYPES([pthread_t], [RX_HAVE_PTHREAD_T=1],  [AC_MSG_ERROR([pthread_t type not found])])

AC_OUTPUT
```

`configure.ac` is the main file that defines how the build system works. Like a
traditional `Makefile`, `configure.ac` allows you to specify compiling options
such as compiler, flags and definitions.

However, `configure.ac` shows its big advantages when it comes to checking for
headers. Checking for headers and libraries is a common task when building a
portable C project to ensure that certain functions are available on the target
system. `configure.ac` provides a set of macros that allow

```ac title="configure.ac" disableCopyButton
# Example: AC_CHECK_HEADERS([header_file], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([fcntl.h],         [], [AC_MSG_ERROR([fcntl.h not found])])

# Example: AC_CHECK_FUNCS([function_name], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
AC_CHECK_FUNCS([fcntl],             [], [AC_MSG_ERROR([fcntl not found])])

# Example: AC_CHECK_TYPES([type_name], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
AC_CHECK_TYPES([pthread_t], [RX_HAVE_PTHREAD_T=1],  [AC_MSG_ERROR([pthread_t type not found])])
```

`configure.ac` also allows you to break down your `Makefile` into smaller files
with the builtin support of subdirectories:

```ac title="configure.ac" disableCopyButton
AC_CONFIG_FILES([
    Makefile
    src/Makefile
])
```

## Makefile.am

Let's take a look at the content of `Makefile.am` and `src/Makefile.am`:

```makefile title="Makefile.am" showLineNumbers
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
SUBDIRS=src

dist_doc_DATA=README.md
```

```makefile title="src/Makefile.am" showLineNumbers
lib_LTLIBRARIES=libris.la
libwhois_la_SOURCES=whois.c ../include/whois.h

bin_PROGRAMS=whoisclient whoisserver

whoisclient_SOURCES=whoisclient.c
whoisserver_SOURCES=whoisserver.c

whoisclient_LDADD=libwhois.la
whoisserver_LDADD=libwhois.la
```


Instead of defining the rules in a `Makefile`, autotools use `Makefile.am`,
which is a template file that defines the rules for building the project.

To create executables, you need to define the targets in `bin_PROGRAMS`. Each
target will have its own source files and dependencies, which can be defined in
the `<target>_SOURCES` variable.

Another concept of `Makefile.am` is to create a shared library that both targets
use as a dependency. This is done by defining a library in `lib_LTLIBRARIES` and
specifying the source files in `<library>_SOURCES`.


## Running the build process

Autotools requires a few steps to build the project:

1. Run `autoreconf -fi` to generate the `configure` script.

```sh
autoreconf -fi
```

2. Run `./configure` to check for dependencies and generate the `Makefile`.

```sh
./configure
# or
./configure --enable-debug
```

3. Run `make` to build the project.

```sh
make
```


## Advantages

Here are some advantages of using `autotools`:

- `autotools` supports checking for dependencies and libraries, which makes it
easier to build portable C projects.
- `autotools` supports refactoring by allowing you to break down the `Makefile`
into smaller files.
- `autotools` provides different tools for different stages of the build process, which allows you to fine-tune the build process.

## Disadvantages

`autotools` is a powerful build tool that provides many features to help you
build portable C projects. However, `autotools` has some disadvantages:

- `autotools` is complex and has a steep learning curve. It might be difficult
for beginners to understand how to use `autotools` effectively.
- `autotools` is exclusive to Unix-like operating systems, like `GNU Make`.
- `autotools` does not provide a package manager. If you want to use external
libraries, you need to install them manually on your system.


# CMake

[`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) is a cross-platform build tool that allows you to
define the build process in a configuration file.  Like `autotools`, `CMake`
provides a configuration step that generates the build files for the target
system.

That said, Cmake is more modern and easier to use than `autotools`. Cmake
provides a unified build system. Instead of having different tools for different
stages or multiple files for the build process, Cmake provides a single entry
point for the build.

## File structure

Let's take a look at the file structure for a project that uses `CMake`:

```ansi disableCopyButton
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── whois.h
└── src
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── whois.c
    ├── whoisclient.c
    └── whoisserver.c

3 directories, 6 files
```

We are going to reuse the implementation for `whois` project and convert it to
use `CMake`. `CMakeLists.txt` is the main file that defines the build process,
including the source files, dependency checking and compiler flags.

`src/CMakeLists.txt` is a subdirectory file that defines the source files for
the targets. This file is included in the main `CMakeLists.txt` file for
refactoring purposes.

## CMakeLists.txt

Let's take a look at the content of `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(using-cmake)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Set common compiler flags
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-Wall -Werror")

# Check for header files
include(CheckIncludeFile)
check_include_file(fcntl.h HAVE_FCNTL_H)
check_include_file(unistd.h HAVE_UNISTD_H)
check_include_file(sys/socket.h HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H)
check_include_file(netinet/in.h HAVE_NETINET_IN_H)
check_include_file(arpa/inet.h HAVE_ARPA_INET_H)
check_include_file(sys/types.h HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H)
check_include_file(sys/stat.h HAVE_SYS_STAT_H)
check_include_file(stdlib.h HAVE_STDLIB_H)
check_include_file(stdio.h HAVE_STDIO_H)
check_include_file(string.h HAVE_STRING_H)
check_include_file(errno.h HAVE_ERRNO_H)
check_include_file(signal.h HAVE_SIGNAL_H)
check_include_file(sys/time.h HAVE_SYS_TIME_H)
check_include_file(time.h HAVE_TIME_H)

# Check for functions
include(CheckFunctionExists)
check_function_exists(fcntl HAVE_FCNTL)
check_function_exists(socket HAVE_SOCKET)
check_function_exists(bind HAVE_BIND)
check_function_exists(listen HAVE_LISTEN)
check_function_exists(accept HAVE_ACCEPT)
check_function_exists(close HAVE_CLOSE)
check_function_exists(read HAVE_READ)
check_function_exists(write HAVE_WRITE)
check_function_exists(recv HAVE_RECV)

# Check for declarations
include(CheckSymbolExists)
check_symbol_exists(NULL "stddef.h" HAVE_NULLPTR)

# Check for type definitions
include(CheckTypeSize)
check_type_size(pthread_t HAVE_PTHREAD_T)
check_type_size(int8_t HAVE_INT8_T)
check_type_size(ssize_t HAVE_SSIZE_T)
check_type_size(size_t HAVE_SIZE_T)
check_type_size(u_char HAVE_U_CHAR)

# Add subdirectories
add_subdirectory(src)
```

It is pretty similar to `configure.ac`. We define some common variables such as
compiler, compiler flags, dependency checking and include the subdirectory file.
However, `CMake` provides a more robust and concise way to achieve the goal.

## src/CMakeLists.txt

Let's take a look at the content of `src/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake title="src/CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(using-cmake)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add compiler flags based on the build type
if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE MATCHES Debug)
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -DDEBUG -g -O0")
else()
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -Wextra -O3")
endif()

# Compile shared library
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON)

# Add source code to library
add_library(whois whois.c ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/whois.h)
target_include_directories(whois PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

# Compile target whoisclient
add_executable(whoisclient whoisclient.c)

# Link whoisclient with whois library
target_include_directories(whoisclient PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_link_libraries(whoisclient whois)

# Compile target whoisserver
add_executable(whoisserver whoisserver.c)

# Link whoisserver with whois library
target_include_directories(whoisserver PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_link_libraries(whoisserver whois)
```

The structure of the `CMakeLists.txt` file is also similar to `Makefile.am`. We
define executables by using `add_executable(<name> <options>... <sources>...)`.[^2]
Each target has its own source files, include directories and linkages.

We can also define a shared library for performance purposes by using
`add_library(<name> <options>...<sources>...)`[^3]. This library can be
compiled once and reused by other targets.

## Running the build process

To build the project using `CMake`, you need to create a build directory and
run the `cmake` command to generate the build files:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # or Release
make
```

## Advantages

- `CMake` is a cross-platform build tool so you can build your C project on many
major operating systems.
- `CMake` provides a unified configuration file that allows you to define your
build process, including compiler flags, dependencies, source files and
executables.
- `CMake` also provides modules that allow you to check for dependencies, or
install one if you need to such as [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html).

## Disadvantages

CMake is considered the de facto build tool for C and C++ projects. However, it
still has some common negative feedback:

- Its syntax is cumbersome to work with. A simple project can be defined in an
unnecessarily complex way.
- Its documentation is often cryptic and esoteric because it does not provide
a clear, explicit explanation  of the modules.
- There are hardly any example codes in the documentation. Most of the time,
you have to rely on reading other people's code on GitHub/GitLab.

# Conclusion

In this post, we have explored different build tools for C/C++ projects. `GNU
Make` is a smallest and most simple tool that is suitable for small projects.
Even bigger projects still use `GNU Make` for fine-grained controls. `GNU
Autotools` provides a large set of tools that support specific stages of the
build process. It is suitable for large projects, especially those written in
Linux. Then, we have `Cmake`, a cross-platform build tool that provides a
unified configuration file for the build process. It is suitable for major
projects and has become the industry standard for C/C++ projects.

If you are new to C/C++, I would recommend learning `GNU Make` first to
understand how build tools work and orchestrate. Learn and try it out to see
what it brings and what it misses. Then, you can move on to `CMake` to learn
to build a more complex project that requires more features such as dependency
checking, shared libraries, testing and cross-platform support.
